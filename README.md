# Cherry üçí
With the vast number of courses on offer at UIUC and the wide variation in average GPA, instructor quality, prereqs, and number of GenEds fulfilled, picking the best course to take is hard.

Cherry aims to solve this to make course picking super easy. Just open Cherry, and see a list of all the courses at UIUC sorted by highest to lowest GPA. You can search by departments and even filter courses based on Gen-Eds you'd like to fulfill, with tons of more planned features coming soon! 

üöÄ Cherry is being actively developed by contributors in Open-Source @ Illinois. Be a part of cherry by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sKYtc9QhuP)!

## Project Charter

### Vision

To help UIUC students plan and schedule their courses according to their varied needs better

### Mission

To create a tool to help students select classes

### Success Criteria

1. Is it better than the current alternatives?
2. Are we using it to select our own courses?
3. Are a majority of users are consistently using cherry? 

<!-- 


Class-Optimizer allows any student to select a personalized optimization strategy for picking the best course for your graduation needs. The student simply ranks their priorities according to their personal preferences like so:

Maximize the following priorities (ranked)
1. the number of previously unfulfilled GenEds met is maximized
2. the average GPA is maximized
3. the average rate my professor score is maximized

subject to:
- no class before 11 AM.

and the optimizer will use [constrained optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_optimization) to provide the top classes that fit the hard and soft constraints.
