This course considers reading as a physical, social, and educational activity that is historically and culturally situated. Drawing upon interdisciplinary scholarship in LIS, education, literature, history, sociology, psychology, raciolinguistics, neuroscience, and anthropology, we investigate different forms of literacy and how people acquire them, with special consideration given to age, race, gender, class, and culture. We explore how our brains learn writing, a human-created technology, and what libraries can do to support literacy acquisition and leisure reading. We examine how literacies (alphabetical, visual, digital, etc.) promise social mobility and equality, yet often reinforce existing power structures. We consider literacy in the context of colonization, Indigenous resistance, immigration policy, and white supremacy. We learn about biases in language education, as well as the stigmatization of particular languages, genres, and groups of readers. Finally, we consider how critical thinking skills offer alternatives to literacy gatekeeping and censorship. For their final project, 4 credit students choose between an experiential track, which offers practical experience through volunteer work, or a scholarship track more focused on research.

938,914578,914578,"Section Info: Topic: Harry Potter and More - When Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was published in June of 1997, it was largely regarded as a piece of children’s fiction about a ten-year-old orphan boy who discovers he has supernatural powers and goes off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. What then made the Harry Potter novels suddenly transform into a cultural phenomenon that captured the imaginations of both children and adults? Why have these novels become the backbone of a global literary empire? What is the magic behind Harry Potter?   In this course, we’ll explore the mythos of the Harry Potter novels and how they’re steeped in a rich tradition of British literature. We’ll focus on social justice and examine the political forces that led to the formation of fantasy literature as a separate genre in the UK and what makes British fantasy novels unique. Our excursion into fantasy literature will reveal how these tales became a covert way to explore the inequalities that the Industrial Revolution ignited; a rising entrepreneurial middle class and a permanent underclass held in place by rigid policies guided by genetic superiority that led to the Brexit vote of 2016. Our centerpiece this semester will be Harry Potter and his battle with the Dark Lord, Tom Marvolo Riddle representing two opposing views of the past, present and future of Britain—the alt-right vs. a progressive pluralistic society. Through these novels we’ll discuss a variety of subjects including social class, language, gender, identity politics, immigration policies, education, disability rights and technology.  Students will be expected to engage actively in in the classroom and to write three papers and give oral reports on the historical and political history of the novels we’re studying. Novels include: Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows.",,,,,,,,ENGL 119,Literature of Fantasy,3,[],data/courses/courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2021/spring/ENGL/119.html,2021,spring,ENGL,2021-sp,2021.0,Spring,ENGL,119.0,Literature of Fantasy,ONL,5.0,11.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Baron, Iryce W",3.766,27.0

We will explore the ways in which documentary filmmaking shapes our image of America in the works of Michael Moore, Errol Morris, Andrew Jarecki and others. Documentary films try to capture a social reality unmediated by fantasy and as such they provide us with a piercing look at who we are. By studying the composition of narrative voice and sequence, the course emphasizes on documentary as a narrative form designed to integrate critical perspectives with social action. This course takes advantage of the many media available for us to expand our appreciation of a multilayered society. Our syllabus includes films, reading assignments, and opportunities to listen to public speakers.  Themes for discussion include: war and its aftermath, the state of the economy, health care, mental illness, poverty, world resources, food production, and the environment.

9749,923389,923389,"Section Info: The Sociology of Political Polarization: Bigots and Snowflakes  Recent years have revealed significant changes in how we think and talk about controversial sociopolitical issues. Communicating across ideological divides has become increasingly difficult and conversations on important issues (those that touch race, gender, or immigration, for example) often lead nowhere. This is, in part, due to a collective tendency to oversimplify problems that are anything but simple. We create binaries where none exist and force people into positions that can be labeled as: for or against, good or bad, and right or wrong. These divides are further compounded by the absence of an explicit recognition of differences in how people understand and interpret the world. In this course, we will examine the prevalence, nature, and sources of these communication breakdowns.",,,,,,,,SOC 230,The Sociology of Political Polarization: Bigots and Snowflakes,3,[],data/courses/courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2021/spring/SOC/230.html,2021,spring,SOC,2021-sp,2021.0,Spring,SOC,230.0,Soc of Political Polarization,OLC,14.0,10.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,"Redstone, Ilana",3.624,31.0

870,914510,914510,"Credit: 4 hoursSection Title: Jane Austen and FeminismSection Info: English 455 - Topic: “Jane Austen and Feminism” -The politics of Jane Austen’s fiction continues to spark lively debate within the vast critical industry that has sprung up, since the 1980s, around all things Austen.  For some, Austen was a quintessentially conservative novelist, seemingly untouched by the revolutionary changes taking place in Europe during her teenage years—a staunch defender of tradition and duty over individual rights, and of oppressive gender norms over women’s agency.  For others, Austen was a novelist ahead of her time, whose commitment to gender equality is implicit in her novels’ call to women to cultivate good judgment and seek “rational happiness,” and in her highly satirical depiction of patriarchs and other pillars of society in virtually all her novels.  Outside of academia, we see a similar division of opinion about Austen’s politics, with her work being invoked, on the one hand, by Alt-Right websites, and, on the other hand, by the ever-growing ranks of “Janeites,” predominantly young women who feel liberated by the experience of reading novels like Pride and Prejudice and Emma.  This course enters these debates by situating some of Austen’s most popular works against the backdrop of feminism as it developed from the seventeenth century to the present.  We will focus on the contributions of three crucial feminist figures: the philosophers Mary Astell (sometimes described as the “first English feminist”) and Mary Wollstonecraft (known as “the mother of liberal feminism”), and the recently deceased Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose work has profoundly impacted women’s rights in the United States and whose pop-culture fame (as “the notorious RBG”) rivals Austen’s.  Readings for the course will include at least four of Austen’s six major novels (and definitely Pride and Prejudice), selected legal opinions and other writings by RBG, Astell’s A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, By a Lover of Her Sex (1694) and Some Reflections upon Marriage (1700), and selections from Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).Restriction(s): Restricted to Graduate - Urbana-Champaign.",,,,,,,,ENGL 455,Major Authors,3;4,[],data/courses/courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2021/spring/ENGL/455.html,2021,spring,ENGL,2021-sp,2021.0,Spring,ENGL,455.0,Jane Austen and Feminism,ONL,1.0,10.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Nazar, Hina",3.588,25.0

Junior priority enrollment begins December 4th. All Restrictions lifted at 9:00 am on December 7th.   Schizophrenia is a catastrophic mental illness that is characterized by psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. However, current views suggest that schizophrenia may be the most extreme manifestation of a continuum of impairment known as schizotypy. This course will examine historical and contemporary views of the etiology and phenomenology of schizotypy (and by extension schizophrenia and related disorders). The course will also explore research methods for studying such topics. The goal of the course is for students to have a basic understanding about the clinical literature and research methods regarding schizotypy and schizophrenia, and be able to use this framework to consider other forms of psychopathology. **Elective course for Clinical/Community or Intradisciplinary Psychology Concentration**Restriction(s): Restricted to Undergrad - Urbana-Champaign.",,,,,,,,PSYC 496,Adv Current Topics in Psych,2,[],data/courses/courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2021/spring/PSYC/496.html,2021,spring,PSYC,2021-sp,2021.0,Spring,PSYC,496.0,Restorative Justice,OLC,0.0,20.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,"Lyubansky, Mikhail",3.535,38.0

Examining such topics as contraception, abortion, the feminist health movement, LGBTQ+ activism, and changing gender roles and values surrounding marriage and extra-marital sex, we will interrogate what the term “sexual revolution” has meant historically and where and when such “revolutions” have occurred. We will begin this class by exploring the key markers of the “sexual revolution” that occurred in the US and Western Europe in the 1960s and 70s, before we move on to consider whether or not the idea of “sexual revolution” aptly describes transformations in sexual norms and practices in non-Western locations since the 1960s. If the concept of “sexual revolution” is indeed transportable, what light does it shed on transformations in society and cultural values globally in the last (roughly) 60 years?",,,,,,,,HIST 200,Intro Hist Interpretation,3,[],data/courses/courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2021/spring/HIST/200.html,2021,spring,HIST,2021-sp,2021.0,Spring,HIST,200.0,Intro Hist Interpretation,ONL,0.0,9.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Hogarth, Rana",3.492,21.0

We will pair early modern drama, poetry, court cases, political tracts, and other texts with readings from contemporary transgender and queer theorists. Topics will include: colonial gender imperatives, medicalization, gender euphoria, rogue sexualities, and self-fashioning. Together, we will theorize the connections and potential that the long history of trans bodies might have for contemporary trans social issues and activisms.

Cities have long been viewed as symbols of what humans are, of what we do and make. We will immerse ourselves in this history and think together about how these places have been experienced and interpreted, especially how everyday city life has been viewed as evidence for thinking about such big questions as modernity, morality, transgression, sex, violence, crime, gender, class, race, ethnicity, power, and resistance. We will enter this history through scholarly writings, memoirs, interviews, primary texts, photographs, film, literature, and art.

Description:  This course examines the role of diplomatic and military intelligence in the political history of major global events and developments from antiquity to the present day, but with a primary focus on the twentieth century. We will study the histories of several major intelligence organizations, as well as the roles played by smaller and non-institutional actors in the global production of intelligence. This course focuses on the interplay between intelligence, state policy, and information environments, in order to understand not only the role intelligence played in major events, but also how intelligence practices shaped and reflected political cultures across the world. Through course lectures, reading assignments, class attendance, and engagement in class discussion, students will develop both a large factual knowledge of the role of intelligence in global history, as well as conceptual understandings of how states and non-state actors come to make threat assessments and take decisions.",,,,,,,,HIST 311,Global History of Intelligence,3,[],data/courses/courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2021/spring/HIST/311.html,2021,spring,HIST,2021-sp,2021.0,Spring,HIST,311.0,Global History of Intelligence,LCD,0.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Brennan, James R",3.175,21.0

Throughout the semester, we will address questions such as: What is cinema and what is film studies?  How do we relate to and interact with films and media?  What are the relationships among film, media, and the larger global society?  We will discuss the historical and cultural context in which particular theories emerged, and we will reflect on the role of film theory in the development of film studies as a discipline.  Additionally, we will look at how film studies has both taken up and influenced theoretical lines of thought such as ideology, Marxism, semiotics, Russian formalism, psychoanalysis, poststructuralism, feminism, critical race theory, sexuality studies, queer theory, transnationalism, and critiques of neocolonialism.  While considering many of the most influential theories in film studies, we will read canonical authors, e.g., Bazin, , Bordwell, Comolli and Narboni, Dyer, Mulvey, Doane, Bhabba, Rodowick, Elsaesser, Bellour, Altman, Gunning.
